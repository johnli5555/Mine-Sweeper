# Mine-Sweeper
Mine-Sweeper is a java program that allows the user to play minesweeper

The functions of the code and its technicalities are documented within the program :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program design: 
My Minessweeper java program is designed to immitate the actual minesweeper game. It works
off of manipulating a grid that stores the location of mines and number of mines in 
adjacent squares.

Features:
- Customizable board and number of mines
- Can flag and unflag squares
- The first click will never be a mine
- When the game is lost the program will inform the locations of all mines(M) and incorrectly
  flagged squares (NM for not mine)
